"""Plugin interfaces.

A MessageGenerator turns an Event into Messages, a TransportLayer delivers
them, and a Publisher pairs one of each. Publishers run in their configured
order for every event, and each one gets the Deliveries (receipts) of the
publishers before it.

Byte-level consistency: a storage transport returns the Location of what it
stored. Before a generator that needs_content() runs, its Publisher
retrieves every earlier Location and hands over the file actually served, so
e.g. a WNM's integrity always describes the stored file.

The worker runs events in parallel threads and shares one instance of each
plugin between them, so plugins must be thread-safe (or keep per-thread
state themselves)."""
